bug list

spelling errors between the .html and .js files.

I have made that mistake before. I mispelled height and width

Also, made the mistake of using camel notation on the values for mouse inside the events object. The entire string 
should be lowercase.

let events = {
	mouse: {
		down: "mouseDown",
		move: "mouseMove",
		up: "mouseUp",
	},
